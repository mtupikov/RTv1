# RTv1
42 Unit Factory Project

My first Ray Tracer

In this project I've learned how Ray-Tracing technology works, and implemented it with pure C and OpenCL.

4 simple geometric objects: plane, sphere, cylinder and cone.
Program is able to apply translation and rotation transformation to objects before displaying them.

As bonuses: multi light spots, shine effect.

**You are able to fly over the scene and choose objects to see their info**
